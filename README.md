Title: Akashic Password

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/0zadRObNDmM
Description:
This project is a password manager that securely stores, retrieves, and encrypts account information. It features a custom encryption and decryption mechanism to protect sensitive user data. The informations are stored in a csv file called "accounts.csv". Although the csv file is bare and seemingly unprotected in the project folder. The contents are encrypted and will be difficult to read and analyze without being decrypted. The only way to access the information stored inside will be by decrypting it with the project.

Akashic password is a password manager with it's own custom Password class that I created so that it will be able to encrypt and decrypt texts inputted in it. By using a randomly scrambled texts of characters encryption and decryption is made possible. The encryption and decryption works by getting the index of each character on a specified list or ordered characters, then it will use that index number in getting the character present in another scrambled list of characters. By doing so encryption is made possible.

When running the file, the user will be able to select options 1â€“5 from the menu, and follow prompts to manage accounts. Choosing options will enable the user to run the password manager similar to running an ATM. The user will then be able to view the available accounts, upload new accounts, retrieve existing accounts, and remove accounts from the password manager.
